Here a short description of my research activities (topics and publications)

## [](#header-2)Topics

My leading research activity is (computatinal) **reasoning under uncertainty** which is a field of data sciences and artificial intelligence. 

Uncertainty arise in many circumstances:
* data is noisy (e.g. photon counting data is Poisson distributed),
* we need a simpler picture (e.g. a brownian motion describes general statistical properties of the movement of a dust particle),
* data is missing (e.g. the value of a feature is unknown for some examples of the dataset).

**Probabilities** are an appealing mathematical model to grasp uncertainty. However, there several kinds of uncertainty and, in particular, imprecision needs special care to be correctly modeled. When the truth or the falsity of a proposition cannot be determined in light of evidence, one can introduce a third epistemic state: the _don't know_ state. Probabilities can be distributed on each state as usual. By building upon this idea, we see that probability triplets for each proposition must follow some rules. This is one way to derive the framework of the theory of **belief functions** in which I made most of my contributions.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
