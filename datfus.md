## Detailed description of the DatFus unit (DAD option, Centrale Lille)

In this unit, the information fusion paradigm is presented. For any prediction task, multiple algorithmic solutions are possible and some of them have comparable performances, making it hard to go for a given a priori. Information fusion proposes to use each algorithm in a first phase and to combine the set of predictions in a second phase.

We review information models wrt data types: point-valued, multi-valued, ranked, uncertain or functional data. For each data type, we examine voting and aggregation techniques. A focus on information in machine learning is proposed at the end of the unit. We relate information fusion to notions (bagging, boosting or Bayesian learning) presented in other units.
